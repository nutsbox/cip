## Welcome to cip

You can use cip as an alternative tool for encryption, decryption, B64 encoding/decoding, and hashing of given string or file.

### Features
* String or file hashing
* String or file encryption / decryption
* String or file B64 encoding / decoding
* UUID generation
* UUID generation based on given string or file (maybe considered as UUID hash)
* Cross-platform - cip has been tested to run on Windows (XP, 7, 10), Linux (Ubuntu 18.0, Centos 7.x and above, Termux in Android), FreeBSD-11 and Mac OSX (Yosemite, Mojave, Catalina). You may need to recompile if you want to port it to other operating system.
