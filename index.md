## Welcome to cip

You can use cip as an alternative tool for encryption, decryption, B64 encoding/decoding, and hashing of given string or file.

### Features
* [String or file hashing](#string-or-file-hashing)
* String or file encryption / decryption
* String or file B64 encoding / decoding
* UUID generation
* UUID generation based on given string or file (maybe considered as UUID hash)
* Cross-platform: cip has been tested to run on Windows (XP, 7, 10), Linux (Ubuntu 18.0, Centos 7.x and above, Termux in Android), FreeBSD-11 and Mac OSX (Yosemite, Mojave, Catalina). You may need to recompile if you want to port it to other operating system.

### License
I consider cip, itself, as Public Domain (PD). But I used some libraries that are not public domain and due credit and license applies to these libraries.

### Usage
`cip` commands are consistent across different supported OS.

usage: cip [OPTIONS [SUB-PARAM]...]
encrypts, decrypts and hashes key for a given string or file

-s   <string>          the string to encrypt, decrypt or to hash
-f   <filename>        the file to encrypt, decrypt or to hash


 -t*  [algorithm]       where '*' should be replaced by 's' or 'f'
                        performs hash on given string (-ts) or filename (-tf)
                        supported algorithms: md2 md4 md5 sha1 sha224 sha256

 -len <length>          custom hash length (in bytes) for shake3-128/256.
                        defaults: shake3-128 (16 bytes), shake3-256 (32 bytes)

 -k   <key>             key as required by the following:
                        - siphash (i.e., SipHash-2-4): 16 characters
                        - ciphers (see below). if not given, user will be prompted
                        to provide a key--no specific number of characters
                        required for cipher (think of this like a password)

 -b*  [outfile]         where '*' should be replaced by 'e' to encode
                        or 'd' to decode in base64 the given string through '-s'
                        or file through '-f' options. if outfile is not specified,
                        result will be dump to the screen (i.e., stdout)

 -u[*]                  where '*' may be replaced by 's' or 'f'
                        generates uuid4 randomly (-u) or from given string (-us)
                        or filename (-uf)

 -e*  [outfile]         where '*' should be replaced by 's' or 'f'
 -d*  [outfile]         encrypts or decrypts a string (-es|-ds)
                        given through '-s' or file (-ef|-df) given through '-f'
                        and outputs to screen or to [outfile]. if '-c' is not
                        specified, aes is the cipher used by default.

 -c   <cipher>          cipher to use for encryption/decryption.

#### String or file hashing
`cip` supports the following hashing algorithms: md2, md4, md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, sha512-224, sha512-256, sha3-224, **sha3-256** (_default_), sha3-384, sha3-512, blake2b-160, blake2b-256, blake2b-384, blake2b-512, whirlpool, tiger, blake2s-128, blake2s-160, blake2s-224, blake2s-256, rmd128, rmd160, rmd256, rmd320, chc_hash, siphash, crc32, adler32, shake3-128, and shake3-256.
##### Hash a string using sha3-256 (default) Algorithm
```markdown
C:\>cip -s "Hello World!" -ts
d0e47486bbf4c16acac26f8b653592973c1362909f90262877089f9c8a4536af
```
The output of `cip -h` shows that to select an algorithm, you have to use `-t*` followed by the name of the algorithm. If no name is provided, `cip` defaults to **sha3-256**. The `*` is to be replaced by either `s` or `f`. If you are hashing a string, the option becomes `-ts`. To hash a file, the option becomes `tf`. The following examples depict this point:
##### Hash a string using md5 algorith
```markdown
C:\>cip -s "Hello World!" -ts md5
ed076287532e86365e841e92bfc50d8c
```
Not changing  `-t*` to either `-ts` or `-tf` results to an error:
```markdown
C:\>cip -s "Hello World!" -t*
no given operation(s) to perform
type "cip -h" for help

C:\>cip -s "Hello World!" -t* md5
no given operation(s) to perform
type "cip -h" for help

C:\>cip -s "Hello World!"
no given operation(s) to perform
type "cip -h" for help
```
